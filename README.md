# Hi, I’m Oscar Garcia

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University  
💼 I'm working toward a future in Medical IT — ideally at Kaiser Permanente  
🛠️ I enjoy building PCs, and implementing my own questions into my work 
📦 This GitHub contains coursework, personal projects, and growing experience with:

- Java (core focus from homework and classwork)

💡 I’m especially interested in the topics of **healthcare and technology**, and how IT can improve lives through efficiency, data, and innovation.
